# seraphim-escape-pi-server

## To run
`npm install`

`node ./app.js`

## Notes

This node server was designed to be run on a pi, however its is fully tested and working on any other system running node.

Also it was using an older version of node so some newer packages may not be compatible with newer versions of node.
